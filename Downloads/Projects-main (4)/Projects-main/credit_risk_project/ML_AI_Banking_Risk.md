# 💳 Credit Risk Evaluation Using Decision Trees

## 📌 Problem Statement
Lending institutions face high default rates when credit assessments are based on manual or incomplete evaluation methods. Traditional credit scoring methods lack personalization and adaptability, especially for new applicants with limited histories.

## 🎯 Objective
To build a machine learning model that predicts the credit risk level of loan applicants, enabling smarter loan approvals and minimizing defaults.

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Investigated key borrower attributes: income, employment status, credit history length, outstanding debts.
- Identified correlations between loan default and features like debt-to-income ratio, prior defaults, and loan purpose.
- Visualized default rates across different applicant categories to identify risk clusters.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Concepts Used
- **Decision Tree Classifier** for interpretable model building.
- **Train/Test Split** and **Cross-Validation** for robust evaluation.
- **Confusion Matrix**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1 Score** to measure model performance.
- **Feature Importance Ranking** to understand the most predictive borrower attributes.

## 📈 Impact and Economic Relevance
From an economics perspective, this project addresses key concepts like **risk-adjusted pricing**, **moral hazard**, and **asymmetric information** in credit markets:
- Enabled **risk-based segmentation** of borrowers, reducing exposure to high-risk profiles.
- Supported interest rate differentiation and policy lending strategy.
- Achieved ~85% prediction accuracy, allowing potential reduction in default rates and improved portfolio stability.

## 🧩 Business Value
By integrating this model:
- Banks can make **data-driven lending decisions** that reduce non-performing assets (NPAs).
- Credit officers can interpret risk factors easily due to the transparency of the decision tree.
- Lenders can extend more loans to low-risk applicants, supporting financial inclusion.
